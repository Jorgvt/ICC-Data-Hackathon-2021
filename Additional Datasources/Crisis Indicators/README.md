This dataset contains information on crisis-related events, with specific information on the incident, coordinates, etc. 
There are 3 files:

#### [country.csv](country.csv)

Extense information on each country.

#### [sources.csv](sources.csv)

Contains the sources used to extract the information.

#### [crisis0.zip](crisis0.zip) and [crisis1.zip](crisis1.zip)

The crisis dataframe has been split into two (due to size limitations in Github). It contains information on the different crisis-related events, including positional references.
