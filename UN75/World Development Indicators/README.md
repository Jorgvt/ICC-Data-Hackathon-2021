| *File or folder*                                            | *Description*                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`World Development Indicators`**                                         | Contains an index of all the indicators |
| **`Dataset`**                                  | This folder contains a large dataset of each World Development Indicator. In order to make it more manageable, it has been divided into subsets. The criteria followed is using the first component of the id of an indicator as the grouping value for that subset, i.e "AG.LND.ARBL.HA" and "AG.SRF.TOTL.K2" are both under the "AG.csv" file.
