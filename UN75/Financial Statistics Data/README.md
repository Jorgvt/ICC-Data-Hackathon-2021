# FINANCIAL STATISTICS DATA

The United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB) Financial Statistics database is the only comprehensive source of financial statistics for the organizations of the United Nations system.

Data is collected from 43 United Nations entities (in some instances with further disaggregation) and figures are validated with the organizationsâ€™ audited financial statements wherever possible. This data is currently collected annually by the CEB Secretariat, as originally mandated by the Administrative Committee on Coordination (General Assembly decisions 47/449, 53/459, 57/557 and 57/558) and is the basis for the preparation of the statistical report of CEB on the budgetary and financial situation of the organizations of the United Nations system to the General Assembly and the DESA Report on the Operational Activities for Development.
