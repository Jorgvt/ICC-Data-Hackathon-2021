# ICC-Data-Hackathon-2021

The Challenges 

Challenge 1 - Covid-19 Simulate Pandemic Recovery 
•	The challenge is to analyze patterns related to the Covid-19 spread in a specific region. 
•	The challenge is to measure effectiveness of stay-at-home orders during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Ex: Daily mobility data on how many miles were driven within each zip code in the country became a proxy for the effectiveness of the stay-at-home orders.

Challenge 2 - Predict Refugee Migration 
•	The additional variables include geo location data. Furthermore, some questions are answered in different scales from challenge, thus provide a little more complexity for analysis. 
•	Predict migration pattern.

Challenge 3 – Celebrate UN 75 years 
•	Visualize and help raise public aware of the events related to UN 75 years.
•	AI to identify Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) related events from conversations on global social media. 

Creativity is fully encouraged - any interesting or novel ways to look at and segment the data will be valuable and engaging for all.
