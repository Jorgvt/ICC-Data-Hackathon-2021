The Challenges 

[Challenge 1 - Covid-19 - Open Challenge](COVID-19)

Covid-19 has been the biggest challenge in the past year. We are now entering a new phase: vaccination.
This may change the patterns of the pandemic.
Some of the research questions are:

  1. How can we measure the social economic impact of COVID-19?
  2. How can we identify government crisis response to COVID-19, specifically in regions like - South Africa, Namibia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar, Benin, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guatemala, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, and Rwanda Senegal, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Ukraine, and Zambia? 
  3. How do we measure the impact of COVID-19 public safety responses such as social distancing and curfews?
  4. How do we forecast the impact of phased vaccination cycles globally?

These are all open questions. You are not limited to these questions, this is an open challenge.

[Challenge 3 - UN75 - Visualization Challenge](UN75)

Celebrating the UN’s 75th anniversary, we propose the following challenge –
Our vision is a world where the people and the planet get the support they need – in the moments that matter most. The UN ecosystem as a whole focuses on maximizing the value of our data responsibly. 

The United Nations envisions to deliver the following decade of actions - SDGs by 2030:

- Climate action 
- Gender equality
- Human rights and the rule of law 
- Peace and security



With this in mind:
1.	Visualize the United Nations accomplishments for the last 75 years.
2.	Explore the impact the United Nations has made in the last 75 years.
3.	Identify and share insights on how the SDG goals have been implemented globally thus far. 

Creativity is fully encouraged - any interesting or novel ways to look at and segment the data will be valuable and engaging for all.
